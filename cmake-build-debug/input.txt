ONCE_IT_SMILED_A_SILENT_DELL
WHERE_THE_PEOPLE_DID_NOT_DWELL;
THEY_HAD_GONE_UNTO_THE_WARS,
TRUSTING_TO_THE_MILD-EYED_STARS,
NIGHTLY,_FROM_THEIR_AZURE_TOWERS,
TO_KEEP_WATCH_ABOVE_THE_FLOWERS,
IN_THE_MIDST_OF_WHICH_ALL_DAY
THE_RED_SUN-LIGHT_LAZILY_LAY.
NOW_EACH_VISITOR_SHALL_CONFESS
THE_SAD_VALLEY'S_RESTLESSNESS.
NOTHING_THERE_IS_MOTIONLESS_--
NOTHING_SAVE_THE_AIRS_THAT_BROOD
OVER_THE_MAGIC_SOLITUDE.
AH,_BY_NO_WIND_ARE_STIRRED_THOSE_TREES
THAT_PALPITATE_LIKE_THE_CHILL_SEAS
Around the misty Hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
Uneasily, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye --
Over the lilies there that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave: -- from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep: -- from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.
